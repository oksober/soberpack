# ðŸŽ¤ soberpack



A curated collection of original samples, loops, and synth presets crafted for ambient, dreamy, and experimental soundscapes. Designed for musicians who seek texture, mood, and sonic depth.



## ðŸŒŒ Contents



- `samples/` â€” WAV \& FLAC recordings of ambient textures, noise layers, and melodic loops
